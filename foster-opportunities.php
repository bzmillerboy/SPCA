            <h2>Become A Foster Parent</h2>


             <p>Foster parents provide temporary homes for animals prior to adoption. Providing foster care is a wonderful and personal way to contribute to saving and improving the lives of homeless pets.</p>


            <h3>Why Do Pets Need Foster Care?</h3>
            <p>There are several possible reasons:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li>Newborn animals that need to be bottle-fed, or mothers with nursing babies. Very young animals who are weaned but not old enough for adoption also benefit from the care of a foster parent.</li>
                <li>Dogs with mild to moderate behavioral issues who require some behavior modification and work, such as shy dogs who need socializing, and/or Long-time residents at the shelter.</li>
                <li>Feral kittens who need socializing.</li>
                <li>Some animals need time to recover from an illness or injury before adoption, and may need more attentive and personal medical care which can be more easily provided in a foster home.</li>
                <li>Short term care for animals who will be going to a rescue group.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Whatever the reason, these animals need some extra love and care before they can be adopted. Providing foster care for a week, a month, or more can be a lifesaving gift for an animal.</p>
