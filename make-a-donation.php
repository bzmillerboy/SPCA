          <h3>Your company may match your gift!</h3>
          <p>If your employer has a matching gift program, your donation could double or even triple in value! By checking to see if your company matches donations to SPCA Cincinnati you can increase the support to thousands of animals we care for each year!</p>
          <p>Two easy steps:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Obtain a matching gift form from your company’s Personnel Department. Some companies will even match gifts made by spouses and retired personnel.</li>
            <li>Send the completed form to: SPCA Cincinnati, 11900 Conrey Rd., Cincinnati, OH 45249.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>If your employer doesn’t currently participate in a matching gift program, you may be able to encourage your company to enroll and join our efforts to help abandoned and abused animals in the Tri-state area!</p>
