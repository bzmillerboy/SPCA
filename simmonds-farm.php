            <p>In 2009, the Simmonds family made a generous donation to SPCA Cincinnati.  The Simmonds Farm dates back to 1825, and includes two barns, a farmhouse built in 1880, and several smaller outbuildings.  The donation to SPCA Cincinnati also included 25 acres, most of which is surrounded by Hamilton County Parks, situated on the Great Miami River.</p>
            <p>SPCA Cincinnati's goal for Simmonds Farms is to create an educational experience that takes people back to a time when the family farm supplied the food needs for America. Examples of standard of care for animals in the early 20th century will be compared to modern day standards. The hands-on experience will be enjoyable as well as educational. Collaborating with the Hamilton County Park District will make SPCA Cincinnati’s Simmonds Farm and the Simmonds Family Dog Park (coming in 2014) a great experience for young and old alike.</p>
            <p>“We want to ensure that children in and around Hamilton County will be stewards for animal husbandry and agriculture,” says Harold Dates, SPCA Cincinnati President and CEO. “The farm will also be a great atmosphere where children can have access to educational and recreational activities and learn about a healthy lifestyle involving people, animals and the environment.”</p>
