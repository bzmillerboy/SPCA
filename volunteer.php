               <p>Thank you for your interest in volunteering with SPCA Cincinnati! Volunteers contribute to the success of everything we do, and our animals benefit immensely from our volunteers’ time and compassion.  To find out more information about volunteering and to sign up for an orientation class, please email Kelly at <a href="mailto:volunteer@spcacincinnati.org">volunteer@spcacincinnati.org</a>.</p>

            <p><strong>*NOTE</strong> - From this point forward, ALL ORIENTATIONS, regardless of which shelter you would like to volunteer for (whether it be Northside or Sharonville), will be held at the Sharonville Shelter. Please contact us to reserve a spot.</p>

            <h3>Volgistics</h3>
            <p>Already a volunteer? Log in to Volgistics here.</p>
            <a class="btn btn-primary" href="https://www.volgistics.com/ex/portal.dll/?FROM=9463" target="_blank">Launch Volgistics</a>

            <h3>Requirements</h3>
            <p>Each volunteer must attend a three-four hour orientation class. You will need to contact the development coordinator to reserve a spot for the next available orientation (contact information above). If you do not sign up prior to the orientation, you will not be permitted to stay. Included in the orientation is a hands-on leash training and a tour of the Sharonville facility for all volunteers. A tour of the Northside facility will be held directly following the Sharonville portion of the orientation for those volunteers who will be volunteering at the Northside facility.</p>
            <p>Volunteers must be at least 15 years old to volunteer with the animals and until a volunteer is 18 years old, they must have a parent/guardian physically with them at all times.  The parent/guardian is also required to attend an orientation class.</p>
            <p>Volunteers must be able to commit to volunteering for at least an hour a week for the first 3 months following their orientation class and then continue coming in at least twice a month thereafter.  If you cannot fulfill this minimum commitment, we ask that you do not take a spot in the class.</p>
